<p><strong>Earth: Crops, Culture, and Climate (TA, F22; Princeton)</strong></p>
I am currently serving as an assistant instructor for this <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1232&courseid=016425">freshman seminar</a> at Princeton University. 

<p><strong>Sedimentology (TA, S22; MIT)</strong></p>
In the Spring of 2021, I planned a field trip to the Catskills in New York and taught laboratory methods for carbonate sedimentology in this 'seds' course led by my advisor, Kristin Bergmann. Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iUe0mPQ5bOYDTlwWs2c_buoAbize-U68/view?usp=sharing">field guide</a> I developed for this week-long trip.

<p><strong>Sedimentology and Society (TA, S21; MIT)</strong></p>
For this version of Sedimentology, I taught a module titled "Sedimentology of the Black Belt," in which we explored the geologic and sociologic history of the Black Belt region of the southeastern US. Throughout the course (which also covered sedimentology of the Mississippi Delta and of southern Florida), prof. Bergmann and I aimed to make sedimentological concepts societally relevant, illustrating the idea that understanding the geology of a place is important to modern issues. 

<p><strong>Racism, Colonialism, and Extraction in the Geosciences (co-leader, S21,S22; MIT)</strong></p>
Read more about this seminar course, which I developed with four other graduate students, under the TIDE Seminar heading.

<p><strong>First year grad seminar (TA, F19; MIT)</strong></p>
After helping conceive of this course during AY17-18, I TA'd the second iteration of it -- I led half of the class meetings, which were aimed at demystifying the "hidden curriculum" of the PhD program in EAPS at MIT. The other half of class meetings involved reading and discussing "seminal papers" in Earth science. The syllabus and reading list can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A-aI3BX5O8F8G8LbsOMND1MYhuoiS87U/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
