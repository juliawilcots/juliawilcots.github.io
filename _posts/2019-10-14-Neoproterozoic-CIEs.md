(I am "posting" this on the 10/10 post because that's when the conversation actually occurred, but I'm writing this post on 10/14)

Today I suggested an idea that's been floating around in my brain to Kristin. She was intrigued (I think) and told me to come up with a plan (because neither of us are sure it will work).

The idea started last fall when I somehow got it into my head that you might be able to represent stratigraphic columns as (directed) graphs and that might be a useful way of thinking about sequences of rocks. I think you can definitely represent columns as graphs, but whether or not that is useful is still a question I have.

I didn't suggest this graph idea to Kristin. Without mentioning graphs, I pitched an application of this idea to her. I am proposing to examine the Neoproterozoic (late Tonian through Ediacaran) stratigraphy and carbon isotope excursions by comparing sections from around the world. Of course, people have done this to some extent before -- usually by using exclusively carbon isotope data [cite some examples] -- but I am curious about whether or not we can learn more about the nature of these bizarre isotopic excursions by directly comparing the stratigraphy that hosts them globally. There are four components to this research:
1. Intracomparison of CIE-bearing stratigraphy (e.g. compare all Bitter Springs sections to each other)
2. Intercomparison of CIE-bearing stratigraphy (e.g. all Bitter Springs to all Islay)
3. Comparison of CIE-bearing Neoproterozoic stratigraphy with non-CIE-bearing Neoproterozoic straigraphy.
4. (Maybe) Extension beyond the Neoproterozoic.

Each component has a goal or a question to be answered . Currently, I am thinking about them in this way:
1. Is there a characteristic sequence of lithologies that accompanies the excursion? (For example, the PETM is expressed ~globally by an abrupt carbonate to red mud transition.) Is there a characteristic *set* of lithologies that host the excursion? Are there characteristic transitions between lithologies/environmental interpretations in the sequences (e.g. deep > shallow > deep, dolomite > fine grained siliciclastic > limestone, etc.)? Answering this question will shed light onto whether the excursions are representing the same event (climatic or diagenetic). I would like to eventually perform this analysis on every Neoproterozoic CIE (Bitter Springs, Islay, Trezona, Shuram). 
2. Many of the CIEs "look similar" in d13C space (i.e. we can correlated them by a slight stretching or squeezing of the records). But, do the sections in which these CIEs have been measured "look similar" in a lithological space? The implications for this component will be huge *if* I can discern some pattern in each CIE (step 1). *If* 1 works then this step will at least be slightly interesting. If each CIE has a characteristic lithological pattern and the patterns are similar across Neoproterozoic CIE-bearing stratigraphy, then perhaps we can say the excurions are *all* related in some way (we can really just say the expression of the excursion in the rock record is similar, but there are probably arguments to be made that this result could extent to a bolder statement: that the climatic triggers/reactions associated with each CIE are similar.) Or, if the patterns across different CIEs are dissimilar, the opposite may be true: we might need a different explanation for each of the CIEs.
3. It is interesting to think not only about what was happening during the Neoproterozoic CIEs, but also about what was happening when the d13C record has no slope. We've observed that "steady state" Neoproterozoic d13C is about -5 permille -- the lowest steady state value in Earth history. Why? Were the periods of ~-5 permille between CIEs truly times when the carbon cycle was in steady state? What made these times different than the periods that hosted the excursions?
4. The Neoproterozoic was a completely anomalous period in Earth history, so in some sense, comparing it to more recent CIEs can be of limited usefulness. However, so many more researchers have studied the PETM and Phanerozoic extinction-related CIEs that it might be worth performing a similar set of analyses on those sections.
