# Meeting with Kristin
Met with Kristin to talk about Jocelyn's project. I have been feeling like incorporating stratigraphy is too much for her to take on, and I also think her microtextures work needs more beefing up before it's ready. Jocelyn presented at group meeting last week and I was not convinced by her treatment of the data she does have... So, my recommendations for her are:
1. Spend more time with the aggregated data (in the heatmap). What happens when you break each sample into its constituent grains? What about if you eliminate some microtextures and reevaluate? I think this is where most of the work is needed.
2. Do not worry about the stratigraphy. Either I will tackle this part of the paper, or we will leave it out.  

I am mostly concerned that (1) Jocelyn has done a ton of work on microtextures (and no work on stratigraphy), and (2) the discussion re: the Bravika is concerned with whether it should be considered part of the Wilsonbreen or Elbobreen Formations. Kristin and I talked about re-framing Jocelyn's paper as a case study of microtextures, not an analysis of the Bravika.
