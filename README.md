# juliawilcots.github.io

Repo for my website. Built using Hugo. Work in progress.  

/css/  
where the style stuff happens  
files: /style.css and /fonts.css  

menu.html   
doesn't do anything, it's just a place to keep the template for the menu that needs to go on each page. no easy way to un-hardcode this (unless i use javascript or php?).
